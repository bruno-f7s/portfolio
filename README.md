# My portfolio
Hi, my name is Bruno, and I am a data enthusiast. I started working with data during my masterâ€™s degree in innovation management and soon realized that it has become a passion. I currently work as a data consultant for an IT consultancy firm focusing on the area of anti-financial crime where I have developed multiple data analytics' projects for a big German bank since October 2020.

I like to code and work with various technologies like Spark, Python and SQL for various tasks in the context of data science. My aim is to keep improving my skills, so I can continue doing what I enjoy. For this reason, in June 2023, I decided to start building a portfolio on my GitHub page as a fresh hobby to showcase some of my skills and ideas and _hopefully_ to inspire others and learn from others.

If you find any mistake, have a suggestion or simply want to get in touch, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/b-fernandes/) or on [Xing](xing.to/brunofernandes).

# Projects
## [Analysis of Airbnb accomodation's data for Porto, Portugal](https://github.com/bruno-f7s/portfolio/tree/main/airbnb-porto-2023)
Examining the Airbnb accommodation market from June 2022 to March 2023, I analyzed the evolution of occupancy rates, prices, and listing numbers, with the aim of determining the market's post-pandemic state. Additionally, employing machine learning, I tried to predict the prices of an apartment unit.

I wrote this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@brunoipfernandes/post-pandemic-outlook-airbnb-accomodations-in-porto-portugal-58f27207a718) about it, which provides a more contextual analysis of the results.

__Keywords__: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Machine Learning - Communication

## [Disaster Reponse Web App](https://github.com/bruno-f7s/portfolio/tree/main/disaster-response)
In this project, I used labelled data provided by [Appen](https://appen.com/) to create a NLP Pipeline for a model that is able to predict 36 labels for text messages. The labels are related to categories regarding natural disasters and the idea is to categorize a text message for this kind of natural disasters like fire or storm, or specific requests like for water, clothing, etc. The model ought to be deployed onto a Flask app, with the intent of making the model available to end-users through a web app (it can only be accessed using a browser on a local machine). 
The focus on the project was not to achieve a high performance, but rather to focus on the technical aspects of setting up the ETL and ML pipelines as well as on deploying the model.

__Keywords__: Flask App - Multi-Label Classification - NLP


## [Customer Segementation Analysis](https://github.com/bruno-f7s/portfolio/tree/main/arvarto-customer-segmentation)
Using real-world data provided by [Arvato Financial Solutions](https://finance.arvato.com/) the goals of this project were:
- to use unsupervised learning techniques such as dimensionality reduction and clustering to perform a customer segmentation and understand which groups of customers should be prioritized.
- to potentially use a semi-supervised learning approach in order to create a classification model that could predict new customers.

I wrote this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@brunoipfernandes/how-to-perform-data-driven-customer-segmentation-9becb18dc528) that explains my approach in customer segmentation.

__Keywords__: Dimensionality Reduction - Clustering - Semi-Supervised Learning
