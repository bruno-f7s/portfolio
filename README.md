# My own portfolio
Hi, my name is Bruno, and I am a data enthusiast. I started working with data during my masterâ€™s degree in entrepreneurship and soon realized that it has become a passion. I currently work as a data consultant for an IT consultancy firm focusing on the area of anti-financial crime where I develop multiple data analytics' projects for a big German bank since October 2020.

I enjoy a lot coding and working with various technologies like Spark, Python and SQL for various tasks in the context of data science. My aim is to keep improving my skills so I can continue doing what I like. For this reason in June 2023, I decided to start building a portfolio on my GitHub page as a new hobby to showcase some of my skills and ideas and _hopefully_ to inspire others as well as learn from others.

If you find anything wrong, have a suggestion or simply want to ask me something you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/b-fernandes/) or [Xing](xing.to/brunofernandes).
