# My portfolio
Hi, my name is Bruno, and I am a data enthusiast. I started working with data during my masterâ€™s degree in innovation management and soon realized that it has become a passion. I currently work as a data consultant for an IT consultancy firm focusing on the area of anti-financial crime where I have developed multiple data analytics' projects for a big German bank since October 2020.

I like to code and work with various technologies like Spark, Python and SQL for various tasks in the context of data science. My aim is to keep improving my skills, so I can continue doing what I enjoy. For this reason, in June 2023, I decided to start building a portfolio on my GitHub page as a fresh hobby to showcase some of my skills and ideas and _hopefully_ to inspire others and learn from others.

If you find any mistake, have a suggestion or simply want to get in touch, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/b-fernandes/) or on [Xing](xing.to/brunofernandes).

## [Analysis of Airbnb accomodation's data for Porto, Portugal](https://github.com/bruno-f7s/portfolio/tree/main/airbnb-porto-2023)
Examining the Airbnb accommodation market from June 2022 to March 2023, I analyzed the evolution of occupancy rates, prices, and listing numbers, with the aim of determining the market's post-pandemic state. Additionally, employing machine learning, I tried to predict the prices of an apartment unit.

I wrote a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@brunoipfernandes/post-pandemic-outlook-airbnb-accomodations-in-porto-portugal-58f27207a718) about it, which provides a more contextual analysis of the results.
