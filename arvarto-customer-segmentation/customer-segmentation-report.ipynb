    "# Project Introduction - Customer Segmentation\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population with the aim of understanding which segment of the population the company should aim for in its next campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into __two main parts__:\n",
    "1. In the first part the customers will be segmented using a __unsupervised learning approach__ and using the customer's data against the general population's data. Not only is the goal to understand which groups of customers are more interesting for the campaign but also to select the most important features.\n",
    "2. Using the information gained a __supervised learning algorithm__ will be used for a classification task to predict which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company. "
